### Profile
Iâ€™ve been working in mobile software development for almost a decade. I have a lot of experience working in large, complicated code bases. I prefer tabs. I think code style should aid in readability but not hinder development. I can maintain a codebase or build one from the ground up using best practices. I pride myself in the ability to translate technical problems to non-technical people.
